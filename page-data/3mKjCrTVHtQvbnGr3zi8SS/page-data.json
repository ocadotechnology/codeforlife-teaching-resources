It tells you how your program can interact with another program. In this case, it tells you how you can communicate with Kurono.\n\nThe aim of the Kurono game is to move around the map, avoiding obstacles and picking up different types of artefacts to return to a museum. You do this by writing Python code. The map is a 16 x 16 grid of cells and Kurono uses x and y coordinates to identify each cell.\n\n![Game Interface](//images.ctfassets.net/x5ignlfoflka/1aDarh6lfJlKcCULjWYY6G/4ffb141501aefc63be169c573275d476/UI_info_for_Kurono-01.png)\n\nYou type your Python code in the code area and press Run Code to send it to Kurono. Assuming there are no syntax errors, Kurono will update the code it uses for your turn.\nYou will notice your avatar on the map. If you are in classroom, there will lots of others. You can identify youself by the blue symbol and locate your avatar using the Find Me button.\nIf your code prints anything, it will appear in the console area. This can get quite full of messages, so press the bin symbol to clear it.\nIf you need to get the starter code back, press the Reset Code button."}},{"__typename":"Contentful2ColumnLayout","heading":{"name":"Getting started"},"leftColumn":{"leftColumn":"When you first start in Kurono, you will find some code already there. \nThis starter code looks like *[Fig 1]*\n\nKurono uses a similar idea to a traditional board game.
