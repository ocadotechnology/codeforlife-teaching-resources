One curious artefact dating from before the Great Collapse has experts mystified. It's believed to be a time machine – but knowledge of how to make the machine work is long lost, if it ever existed. The only inscription on this machine spells “K U R O N O”.\n"},"rightColumn":{"rightColumn":"![statue2](//images.ctfassets.net/x5ignlfoflka/4pts8teAPhbhOdGzaTM588/4df7be8bea7f47eabc8a88151548dc5f/Group_2.svg)"}},{"__typename":"Contentful2ColumnLayout","heading":null,"leftColumn":{"leftColumn":"![key2](//images.ctfassets.net/x5ignlfoflka/6yV6h3eBzMGYWLiUJLrCXD/e37daa67ed9112572e2c9d5ec40ed19a/key.svg)"},"rightColumn":{"rightColumn":"Each year, the museum’s curator welcomes a class from a local school to look after the exhibits for a few weeks.

That is, until they stumbled across the mysterious time machine and accidentally set its gears in motion. The machine created a spacetime vortex, sucking in many of the museum’s valued possessions. By reading  each object's timecode, it returned  them all back to their original time and location.\n\nAfraid that the incident might cost them their final grades, the students set off to retrieve the items scattered across five timelines using the very same time machine!\n"},"rightColumn":{"rightColumn":"![skull2](//images.ctfassets.net/x5ignlfoflka/7x4NmqqULFjafmJASPKmYR/4cafdea22356858dfd058afe7d70a21d/Group_3.svg)"}}]}},"pageContext":{"contentful_id":"5UCmubaa1VjnCAsxVB70ee"}}}
