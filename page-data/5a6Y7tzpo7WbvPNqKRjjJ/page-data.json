Think about where this would be called from and what code it will replace.\n\n__Extension Task__\n\nYou might have noticed that your avatar is wandering around fairly aimlessly.

These are artefacts: objects you can pick up. There are different types of artefacts, some with a special purpose. For now, your challenge is to pick up any artefact that you find on the map.\n\nIn order to pick up an artefact, you must be standing on the same cell as that artefact and then you need to call some Kurono code to pick it up.\n\nRemember that you can find out your location using `avatar_state.location` which contains the x-y coordinates of your current location:\n\n`coordinates = avatar_state.location`\n\n`print(coordinates)`\n\n```console\nLocation(-15, -11)\nLocation(-14, -11)\n```\n\nYou can ask the Kurono game to tell you if there is an artefact on that cell using the code in fig. X\n\nIf there is an artefact on that cell, you can pick it up using this code:\n\n`action = PickupAction()`\n\nYou then need to return that action at the end of the `next_turn` subroutine, instead of a move.\n\n`return action`\n\nIf you are successful, the artefact will disappear from the map and be moved into your backpack! \nTry changing your code to pick up any artefacts you encounter.\n\nStart with the code in fig.
